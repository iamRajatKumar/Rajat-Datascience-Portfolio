        <p>
          I’m <strong>Rajat Kumar</strong>, a software engineer who loves building things that actually get used.
          For the past few years, I’ve been working as a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>, crafting web
          applications with <strong>Angular, React, Spring Boot, Microservices, and AWS</strong>. I enjoy taking
          ideas from a rough sketch to a production-ready system — clean APIs, reliable services, and polished UIs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, I realised that the products I’m most proud of all have one thing in common:
          they help people make better decisions with <strong>data</strong>. That’s what pushed me toward
          <strong>Data Science &amp; Machine Learning</strong>. Now I’m intentionally transitioning — learning
          <strong>Python, statistics, ML, and MLOps</strong>, and building end-to-end projects that go beyond
          models to solve real business problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most of my learning happens outside “formal” classrooms. I experiment with datasets, follow online
          courses, read blogs, and implement what I learn in side projects. I enjoy turning these projects into
          <strong>blog posts and tutorials</strong> so others can reuse my code, learn faster, and avoid the
          mistakes I made along the way.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the long run, I want to sit at the intersection of <strong>engineering, analytics, and product</strong> —
          building systems that are not just technically solid, but also explainable, ethical, and useful to the
          people who rely on them.
